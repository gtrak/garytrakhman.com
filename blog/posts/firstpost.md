I wanted to bring back my TLD, and I've been meaning to blog again
after a long hiatus. I don't have anything specific to write about
yet, but I do get opinionated about technical topics and occasionally
nontechnical topics as well.  My previous (now deleted) blog's purpose
was to self-promote and further my development career. In 2010 this
seemed like a good idea, but many others have also had that same idea
since then. Consequently, there's a lot of content that I have trouble
motivating myself to read.  There are a lot of intro-level articles
made by and for the new developer.  Occasionally, I can also find
something more specialized and difficult that seems interesting. At
this point I'm too impatient for the easy reads and after paying
attention for a minute or two will jump into skim mode to see if
there's anything worth a closer look.  For the harder reads, I either
know too little about the topic or it would be too risky to apply in
my place of work, so it can feel largely useless at that moment.

Since then, twitter replaced blogging and reading blogs for me.
Unfortunately, while it is a nice way to find content and keep up with
people, it promotes distracted thought. I think most can agree that
when writing larger blocks of text, you can more easily clarify each
thought and test it against your other thoughts to see if makes
sense. With the smaller format, it seems like I'm susceptible to
interruption by (probably also distracted) people posting in
real-time.

So, when I ask myself what's the purpose of this blog, I think it's to
remove those distractions from my own thought process and to rebuild
my own reading and writing habits.
