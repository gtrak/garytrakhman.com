I wanted to bring back my TLD, and I've been meaning to blog again
after a long hiatus. It's not that I have anything specific to write
about yet, but I do get opinionated about technical topics and
occasionally nontechnical topics as well.  The initial blog's (now
deleted) purpose was to get my foot in the door into a development
career as technical marketing. In 2010 this seemed like a good idea,
but many have also had that idea since then. Consequently, I've had
trouble finding consistent content that I was motivated to read.
There are a lot of intro-level articles made by and for the new
developer.  Additionally, I can find something good to read on some
very specialized and more difficult topics. At this point I'm too
impatient for the easy reads and after paying attention for a minute
or two will jump into skim mode to see if there's anything worth a
closer look.  For the harder reads, I either know too little about the
topic or it would be too risky to apply in my place of work, so it can
feel largely useless at that moment.

Since then, twitter replaced blogging and reading blogs for me.
Unfortunately, while it is a nice way to find content and keep up with
people, it promotes distracted thought. I think most can agree that
when writing larger blocks of text, you can more easily clarify each
thought and test it against your other thoughts to see if makes
sense. With the smaller format, it seems like I'm susceptible to
interruption by (probably also distracted) people posting in
real-time.

So, when I ask myself what's the purpose of this blog, I think it's to
remove those distractions from my own thought process and to rebuild
my own reading and writing habits.
