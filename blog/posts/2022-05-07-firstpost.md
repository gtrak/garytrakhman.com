I've been meaning to blog again after a long hiatus. Early in my
development career it was trendy to do so, but in the 2020s there
are just too many blogs out there.

This one will host some technical opinions relevant to what I am working
on, and I will strive to not repeat what is available elsewhere. I will
also not provide tutorials, but I expect might have particular crevices
of technologies to explore and show to others.

Twitter largely replaced blogging and reading blogs for me over the last
few years. Unfortunately, while it is a nice way to find content and
keep up with people, it also promotes distracted thought. I think most can
agree that when writing larger blocks of text, you can more easily
clarify each thought and test it against your other thoughts to see
if makes sense. With the smaller Twitter format, it seems like I'm
susceptible to interruption by likely distracted people posting in real-time.
I need the the bar to be a little higher.

So, when I ask myself what's the purpose of this blog, I think it's to
remove those distractions from my own thought process and to rebuild
my own reading and writing habits.
