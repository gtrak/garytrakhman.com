I am a spouse, professional developer and hobby pianist.

Running, biking and climbing are things I should do and sometimes do.

I provide smoked salmon to a small fluffy white dog.

I work in Ubuntu Linux, Emacs, VS Code, and too many programming
languages, but I try to stay on the functional programming side of
things.
