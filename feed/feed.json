      "content_html": "<p>I wanted to bring back my TLD, and I've been meaning to blog again<br>\nafter a long hiatus. I don't have anything specific to write about<br>\nyet, but I do get opinionated about technical topics and occasionally<br>\nnontechnical topics as well.  My previous (now deleted) blog's purpose<br>\nwas to self-promote and further my development career. In 2010 this<br>\nseemed like a good idea, but many others have also had that same idea<br>\nsince then. Consequently, there's a lot of content that I have trouble<br>\nmotivating myself to read.  There are a lot of intro-level articles<br>\nmade by and for the new developer.  Occasionally, I can also find<br>\nsomething more specialized and difficult that seems interesting. At<br>\nthis point I'm too impatient for the easy reads and after paying<br>\nattention for a minute or two will jump into skim mode to see if<br>\nthere's anything worth a closer look.  For the harder reads, I either<br>\nknow too little about the topic or it would be too risky to apply in<br>\nmy place of work, so it can feel largely useless at that moment.</p>\n<p>Since then, twitter replaced blogging and reading blogs for me.<br>\nUnfortunately, while it is a nice way to find content and keep up with<br>\npeople, it promotes distracted thought. I think most can agree that<br>\nwhen writing larger blocks of text, you can more easily clarify each<br>\nthought and test it against your other thoughts to see if makes<br>\nsense. With the smaller format, it seems like I'm susceptible to<br>\ninterruption by (probably also distracted) people posting in<br>\nreal-time.</p>\n<p>So, when I ask myself what's the purpose of this blog, I think it's to<br>\nremove those distractions from my own thought process and to rebuild<br>\nmy own reading and writing habits.</p>\n",
