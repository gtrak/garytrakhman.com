      "content_html": "<p>I wanted to bring back my TLD, and I've been meaning to blog again<br>\nafter a long hiatus. It's not that I have anything specific to write<br>\nabout yet, but I do get opinionated about technical topics and<br>\noccasionally nontechnical topics as well.  The initial blog's (now<br>\ndeleted) purpose was to get my foot in the door into a tech career.<br>\nIt was tech marketing. In 2010 this seemed like a good idea, but I<br>\nthink a lot of other people had that idea since then. Consequently,<br>\nI've had trouble finding consistent tech blogs that I was motivated to<br>\nread.  There are a lot of intro-level articles made by and for the new<br>\ndeveloper. Additionally, I can find something good to read on some<br>\nvery specialized topics. At this point I'm too impatient for the easy<br>\nreads.  For the harder reads, I either know too little about the topic<br>\nor would try to avoid the risk of applying it in my place of work, so<br>\nit can feel largely useless.</p>\n<p>Since then, twitter largely replaced blogging and reading blogs for<br>\nme. Unfortunately, I think while it is a nice way to find content and<br>\nkeep up with people, it promotes distracted thought. I think most can<br>\nagree that when writing larger blocks, you can more easily clarify each<br>\nthought and test it against others. With the smaller format, it seems<br>\nlike I'm susceptible to interruption by (probably also distracted)<br>\npeople posting in real-time.</p>\n<p>So, when I ask myself what's the purpose of this blog, I think it's to<br>\nremove those distractions from my own thought process and to rebuild<br>\nmy own reading and writing habits.</p>\n",
