      <h3>New blog.</h3>

<p>I wanted to bring back my TLD, and I've been meaning to blog again<br>
after a long hiatus. It's not that I have anything specific to write<br>
about yet, but I do get opinionated about technical topics and<br>
occasionally nontechnical topics as well.  The initial blog's (now<br>
deleted) purpose was to get my foot in the door into a tech career.<br>
It was tech marketing. In 2010 this seemed like a good idea, but I<br>
think a lot of other people had that idea since then. Consequently,<br>
I've had trouble finding consistent tech blogs that are worth reading.<br>
There are a lot of intro-level articles made by and for the new<br>
developer. Additionally, I can find something good to read on some<br>
very specialized topics. At this point, I'm either too impatient for<br>
the easy stuff, or know too little (or frankly try to avoid the risk<br>
at work) to apply the harder writing.</p>
<p>Since then, twitter largely replaced blogging and reading blogs for<br>
me, but I think it only promotes disjointed thought. I think most can<br>
agree that when writing larger posts you more easily clarify each<br>
thought and test it against others instead of being constantly<br>
interrupted by other people seeking distraction at that moment.</p>
<p>So, when I ask myself what's the purpose of this blog, I think it's to<br>
remove those distractions from my own thought process and to rebuild<br>
my own reading and writing habits.</p>
