      <h3>New blog.</h3>

<p>I wanted to bring back my TLD, and I've been meaning to blog again<br>
after a long hiatus. It's not that I have anything specific to write<br>
about yet, but I do get opinionated about technical topics and<br>
occasionally nontechnical topics as well.  The initial blog's (now<br>
deleted) purpose was to get my foot in the door into a development<br>
career as technical marketing. In 2010 this seemed like a good idea,<br>
but many have also had that idea since then. Consequently, I've had<br>
trouble finding consistent content that I was motivated to read.<br>
There are a lot of intro-level articles made by and for the new<br>
developer.  Additionally, I can find something good to read on some<br>
very specialized and more difficult topics. At this point I'm too<br>
impatient for the easy reads and after paying attention for a minute<br>
or two will jump into skim mode to see if there's anything worth a<br>
closer look.  For the harder reads, I either know too little about the<br>
topic or it would be too risky to apply in my place of work, so it can<br>
feel largely useless at that moment.</p>
<p>Since then, twitter replaced blogging and reading blogs for me.<br>
Unfortunately, while it is a nice way to find content and keep up with<br>
people, it promotes distracted thought. I think most can agree that<br>
when writing larger blocks of text, you can more easily clarify each<br>
thought and test it against your other thoughts to see if makes<br>
sense. With the smaller format, it seems like I'm susceptible to<br>
interruption by (probably also distracted) people posting in<br>
real-time.</p>
<p>So, when I ask myself what's the purpose of this blog, I think it's to<br>
remove those distractions from my own thought process and to rebuild<br>
my own reading and writing habits.</p>
