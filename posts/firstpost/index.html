      <h3>New blog.</h3>

<p>I wanted to bring back my TLD, and I've been meaning to blog again<br>
after a long hiatus. It's not that I have anything specific to write<br>
about yet, but I do get opinionated about technical topics and<br>
occasionally nontechnical topics as well.  The initial blog's (now<br>
deleted) purpose was to get my foot in the door into a tech career.<br>
It was tech marketing. In 2010 this seemed like a good idea, but I<br>
think a lot of other people had that idea since then. Consequently,<br>
I've had trouble finding consistent tech blogs that I was motivated to<br>
read.  There are a lot of intro-level articles made by and for the new<br>
developer. Additionally, I can find something good to read on some<br>
very specialized topics. At this point I'm too impatient for the easy<br>
reads.  For the harder reads, I either know too little about the topic<br>
or would try to avoid the risk of applying it in my place of work, so<br>
it can feel largely useless.</p>
<p>Since then, twitter largely replaced blogging and reading blogs for<br>
me. Unfortunately, I think while it is a nice way to find content and<br>
keep up with people, it promotes distracted thought. I think most can<br>
agree that when writing larger blocks, you can more easily clarify each<br>
thought and test it against others. With the smaller format, it seems<br>
like I'm susceptible to interruption by (probably also distracted)<br>
people posting in real-time.</p>
<p>So, when I ask myself what's the purpose of this blog, I think it's to<br>
remove those distractions from my own thought process and to rebuild<br>
my own reading and writing habits.</p>
