  New blog - <time datetime="2021-02-16">16 Feb 2021</time>
</h3>


<p>I wanted to bring back my TLD, and I've been meaning to blog again<br>
after a long hiatus. I don't have anything specific to write about<br>
yet, but I do get opinionated about technical topics and occasionally<br>
nontechnical topics as well.  My previous (now deleted) blog's purpose<br>
was to self-promote and further my development career. In 2010 this<br>
seemed like a good idea, but many others have also had that same idea<br>
since then. Consequently, there's a lot of content that I have trouble<br>
motivating myself to read.  There are a lot of intro-level articles<br>
made by and for the new developer.  Occasionally, I can also find<br>
something more specialized and difficult that seems interesting. At<br>
this point I'm too impatient for the easy reads and after paying<br>
attention for a minute or two will jump into skim mode to see if<br>
there's anything worth a closer look.  For the harder reads, I either<br>
know too little about the topic or it would be too risky to apply in<br>
my place of work, so it can feel largely useless at that moment.</p>
<p>Since then, twitter replaced blogging and reading blogs for me.<br>
Unfortunately, while it is a nice way to find content and keep up with<br>
people, it promotes distracted thought. I think most can agree that<br>
when writing larger blocks of text, you can more easily clarify each<br>
thought and test it against your other thoughts to see if makes<br>
sense. With the smaller format, it seems like I'm susceptible to<br>
interruption by (probably also distracted) people posting in<br>
real-time.</p>
<p>So, when I ask myself what's the purpose of this blog, I think it's to<br>
remove those distractions from my own thought process and to rebuild<br>
my own reading and writing habits.</p>
